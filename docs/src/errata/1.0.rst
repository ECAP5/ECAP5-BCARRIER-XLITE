E001 - Inverted USB DP/DM
-------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-danger:`critical`

   * - Description
     - The USB signals DP/DM are inverted.

   * - Impact
     - The UART-to-USB sub-circuit does NOT work.

   * - Workaround
     - Reword the board to switch the DP/DM signals.

E002 - Missing pull-down on LEDs
--------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-warning:`moderate`

   * - Description
     - The user LEDs input signal is left floating when unconnected/unused.

   * - Impact
     - The LEDs might randomly turn on.

   * - Workaround
     - Add a pull-down resistor on the LEDs inputs.

E003 - LEDs too bright
----------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-info:`low`

   * - Description
     - The LEDs are too bright.

   * - Impact
     - Unconfortable to the eye.

   * - Workaround
     - Decrease the current running through the LEDs by changing resistor values.

E004 - USB TVS orientation
--------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-warning:`moderate`

   * - Description
     - The part used for the TVS diodes of the USB data signals (ESD321) is uni-directional instead of bidirectional as stated in the schematics, and the orientation of the SOD-523 package is difficult to determine. On the first batch of prototypes, the diodes were soldered in reverse, leading to a non-functional USB connection.

   * - Impact
     - There is a risk of soldering the diodes in reverse, leading to a non-functional UART-to-USB sub-circuit.

   * - Workaround
     - None if soldered properly, remove the diodes otherwise.

   * - Linked issue
     - `Issue #20 <https://github.com/ECAP5/ECAP5-BCARRIER-XLITE/issues/20>`_
