   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-primary-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-danger:`critical`

   * - Description
     - The FT232R IC requires a 5V supply voltage whereas the board provides only 3.3v.

   * - Impact
     - The UART-to-USB sub-circuit does NOT work.

   * - Workaround
     - Reword the board to replace the 3.3v LDO (U2) with a 5v LDO. Rework the board to replace the 3.3v connection on the user buttons with a resistor/3.3v zener diode combo connected to the 5v LDO.
