E001 - Wrong UART power
-----------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-danger:`critical`

   * - Description
     - The FT232R IC requires a 5V supply voltage whereas the board provides only 3.3v.

   * - Impact
     - The UART-to-USB sub-circuit does NOT work.

   * - Workaround
     - Reword the board to replace the 3.3v LDO (U2) with a 5v LDO. Rework the board to replace the 3.3v connection on the user buttons with a resistor/3.3v zener diode combo connected to the 5v LDO.

E002 - Missing pull-down on LEDs
--------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-warning:`moderate`

   * - Description
     - The user LEDs input signal is left floating when unconnected/unused.

   * - Impact
     - The LEDs might randomly turn on.

   * - Workaround
     - Add a pull-down resistor on the LEDs inputs.

E003 - LEDs too bright
----------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Impacted revision
     - :bdg-muted-line:`1.0`

   * - Criticity
     - :bdg-info:`low`

   * - Description
     - The LEDs are too bright.

   * - Impact
     - Unconfortable to the eye.

   * - Workaround
     - Decrease the current running through the LEDs by changing resistor values.
