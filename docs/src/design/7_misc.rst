(F4) Miscellaneous
==================

Functional description
----------------------

The board integrates :

* two active-high user push buttons routed to SOM1
* two active-low reset buttons respectively routed to SOM1 and SOM2
* two green user LEDs routed to SOM1, powered by an NPN BJT transistor
* one 3.3V power green LED
* one SMA testpoint for a single-ended signal routed to SOM1
* two SMA testpoints for a differential signal routed to SOM1
* two 4x1 pin headers for JTAG access to respectively SOM1 and SOM2
